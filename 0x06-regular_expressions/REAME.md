0x06-regular_expressions

This project focuses on using regular expressions in Ruby scripts. Each script is designed to match specific patterns based on arguments passed via the command line. The tasks include matching patterns such as "Holberton" with variations like repetition tokens and specific character sequences. Additionally, there are scripts for extracting information from text message transactions in the TextMe app.
